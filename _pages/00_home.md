**The workshop will be held in December 2025.**

In conjunction with [IEEE ICDM](https://icdm2025.org/), the workshop will be held in person. Please see our [schedule](https://icdmw25mmai.github.io/schedule/) for details.

### About Multimodal AI

**Multimodality** is the most general form for information representation and delivery in a real world. Using **multimodal data** is natural for humans to make accurate perceptions and decisions. Our digital world is actually multimodal, combining various data modalities, such as **text, audio, images, videos, touch, depth, 3D, animations, biometrics, interactive content**, etc. **Multimodal data analytics** algorithms often outperform single modal data analytics in many real-world problems.

**Multi-sensor data fusion** has also been a topic of great interest in industry nowadays. In particular, such companies working on **automotive, drone vision, surveillance or robotics** have grown exponentially. They are attempting to automate processes by using a wide variety of control signals from various sources.

With the rapid development of **Big Data** technology and its remarkable applications to many fields, **multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for Big Data is a timely topic. This workshop aims to generate momentum around this topic of growing interest, and to encourage interdisciplinary interaction and collaboration between **Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, audio processing, machine learning, multimedia, robotics, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), social computing, cybersecurity, cloud computing, edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and geospatial computing** communities. It serves as a forum to bring together active researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to share their recent advances in this promising area.
